Rubella IgG (CMIA) 11 IU/mL

Comment on Lab ID 838828312

<5 IU/mL: Not immune

Antibody detected. In an asymptomatic individual this result is consistent
with past infection or vaccination and correlates with protective
immunity.

Please note that the above reference limits are decision limits.

A flag based on these limits is an indication to review the absolute
cardiovascular risk for the patient. For assessment of absolute
cardiovascular disease risk please see www.cvdcheck.org.au

removed

The above decision limits are based on the European Atherosclerosis Society
(EAS) and European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine
(EFLM) Consensus Statement 2016 and the Australasian Association of
Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine (AACB) Lipid Reporting
Guideline 2018.

Lipid treatment targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular
disease:

Total cholesterol <4.0 mmol/L

Triglyceride <2.0 mmol/L

HDL cholesterol >1.0 mmol/L

LDL cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L (<1.8 mmol/L for very high risk)
Non-HDL cholesterol <3.3 mmol/L (<2.5 mmol/L for very high risk)
High risk - Primary prevention Very high risk - Secondary prevention

Target values from the AACB Lipid Reporting Guideline 2018.

Please note that as there is a continuum of risk, benefits are obtained for
any measured lipid components moving towards and beyond the various target
levels.

Vitamin D 73 83 nmol/L (50-140)

Comments on Collection 31/01/24 0727 F:

According to the Position Statement 'Vitamin D and health in adults in
Australia and New Zealand' MJA, 196(11):686-687, 2012, Vitamin D status is
defined as:

Mild Deficiency 30 - 49 nmol/L
Moderate Deficiency 12.5 - 29 nmol/L
Severe Deficiency <12.5 nmol/L

Vitamin D adequacy can be defined as a level >49 nmol/L at the end of
winter - the level may need to be 10 - 20 nmol/L higher at the end of
summer, to allow for seasonal decrease.

From lst November 2014, Medicare rebates for vitamin D testing will apply
to patients at risk of Vitamin D deficiency such as chronic lack of sun
exposure.

Vitamin D 73 83 nmol/L (50-140)

Comments on Collection 31/01/24 0727 F:

According to the Position Statement 'Vitamin D and health in adults in
Australia and New Zealand' MJA, 196(11):686-687, 2012, Vitamin D status is
defined as:

Mild Deficiency 30 - 49 nmol/L
Moderate Deficiency 12.5 - 29 nmol/L
Severe Deficiency <12.5 nmol/L

Vitamin D adequacy can be defined as a level >49 nmol/L at the end of
winter - the level may need to be 10 - 20 nmol/L higher at the end of
summer, to allow for seasonal decrease.

From lst November 2014, Medicare rebates for vitamin D testing will apply
to patients at risk of Vitamin D deficiency such as chronic lack of sun
exposure.

Please note that the above reference limits are decision limits.

A flag based on these limits is an indication to review the absolute
cardiovascular risk for the patient. For assessment of absolute
cardiovascular disease risk please see www.cvdcheck.org.au

The above decision limits are based on the European Atherosclerosis Society
(EAS) and European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine
(EFLM) Consensus Statement 2016 and the Australasian Association of
Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine (AACB) Lipid Reporting
Guideline 2018.

Lipid treatment targets for patients at high risk of cardiovascular

disease:

Total cholesterol <4.0 mmol/L

Triglyceride <2.0 mmol/L

HDL cholesterol >1.0 mmol/L

LDL cholesterol <2.5 mmol/L (<1.8 mmol/L for very high risk)
Non-HDL cholesterol <3.3 mmol/L (<2.5 mmol/L for very high risk)
High risk - Primary prevention Very high risk - Secondary prevention

Target values from the AACB Lipid Reporting Guideline 2018.

Please note that as there is a continuum of risk, benefits are obtained for
any measured lipid components moving towards and beyond the various target
levels.
