UEC Comment

ELEVATED ANION GAP:

An elevated anion gap indicates metabolic acidosis. In uncontrolled diabetes, there is
an increase in ketoacids due to metabolism of ketones. In these conditions, bicarbonate
concentrations decrease by acting as a buffer against the increased presence of acids
(as a result of the underlying condition). The bicarbonate is consumed resulting in a
high anion gap.

ESTIMATED GFR COMMENT:
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) is calculated by the laboratory using the CKD-EPI formula
eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 sq.m —- Normal GFR

Lipid Profile Comment

Target Levels for the general population and the National Vascular Disease Prevention
Alliance (NVDPA) treatment target levels for high-risk people (known coronary heart and
other arterial diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples and familial hyperlipidaemic conditions) are:

Tot. Cholesterol LDL-Cholesterol HDL-Cholesterol
General population: <5.5 mmol/L <2.0 mmol/L M: >=1.0, F: >=1.2 mmol/L
At risk individuals: <4.0 mmol/L <1.8 mmol/L
Fasting Triglycerides: <2.0 mmol/L
Non-HDL Cholesterol: <2.5 mmol/L

National guidelines generally specify specific targets, refer to www.cvdcheck.org.au

ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDES:

Increased levels are seen in primary hypertriglyceridaemic states, and secondary to
Nephrotic syndrome, Hypothyroidism, Pancreatitis, Diabetes mellitus, Alcoholism, oral
contraceptive use or corticosteroid medication.

LOW HDL-CHOLESTEROL :

Low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an
increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

Further assessment through Liposcreen LDL (Lipid) Subfractions to determine any other
lipid anomalies.

ELEVATED NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL LEVEL:

Non-HDL cholesterol surpasses LDL cholesterol as a risk factor for CVD. Increased
non-HDL Cholesterol is a significant marker for subclinical atherosclerosis.
Non-HDL Cholesterol >7.5mmol/L indicates an Increased risk of Familial
Hypercholesterolaemia.

TRIG/HDL RATIO COMMENT:

HDL is closely related to triglycerides. Commonly, patients with elevated triglycerides
also have low HDL levels, along with elevated clotting factor levels.

The triglyceride/HDL ratio is found to be one of the better predictors of heart
disease. Research shows that people with an elevated triglyceride/HDL have 16 times the
risk of heart attack as those with a low/normal ratio. Therefore, in adults, the
triglyceride/HDL ratio should ideally be below 2.0

TRIG/HDL Reference Range:

< 0.9 Considered ideal (minimal risk)

> 1.7 High (moderate risk)

> 2.6 Very High (high risk)

Glucose Comment

ELEVATED FASTING GLUCOSE:

Certain medications may affect results. Please correlate clinically.

In patients with fasting plasma glucose levels between 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or random plasma
glucose levels between 7.8-11.0 mmol/L, an oral Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) should be
performed if the patient is at high risk for diabetes.

Irrespective of any GTT results, a fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9 mmol/L indicates
Impaired Fasting Glucose.

In a patient with symptoms suggestive of Diabetes mellitus, the finding of a fasting
plasma glucose of > 7.0 mmol/L at least two hours following a meal, is diagnostic of
Diabetes mellitus. The finding of either of these levels on two occasions, even in the
absence of symptoms, is also diagnostic of Diabetes mellitus.

FASTING INSULIN Comment:

This reference interval is for fasting, normoglycaemic and non-obese population.

A fasting glucose should be performed together with fasting insulin to ascertain the
HOMA score.

The HOMA score is a standard measure of insulin resistance, It is calculated as
follows; (Blood Glucose X Fasting Insulin) / 22.5.

HOMA Resistance Grade

<= 2.0 Normal

2.1 - 2.2 Borderline

2.3 - 3.0 Moderate

THYROID TEST COMMENTS

TSH has been adopted as the initial test of a thyroid function. Certain medications and
conditions may affect results. Please correlate clinically. Repeat testing in 6-8 weeks
if clinically indicated.

Reference ranges developed using populations without thyroid disease suggest that the
optimal TSH range for thyroid function should be 0.5-2.0OmIU/L.

FREE T4 and FREE T3

Free T4 and T3 represent bioactive portion of thyroid hormone. The test results can
identify functional or subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism and overt hypo- and
hyperthyroidism. T4 converts to active T3 or inactive rT3.

The results should always be interpreted in association with TSH.

REVERSE T3 levels can increase when peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3 is
impaired. Peripheral thyroid imbalances may arise from nutrient deficiencies, heavy
metal exposure, adrenal stress, enzyme deficiencies, and chronic illnesses.

ELEVATED REVERSE T3 LEVEL:

A high or high normal rT3 level may inhibit the action of T3.

Elevated rT3 may therefore lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism even if levels of TSH, T4
& T3 are adequate.

Treatment Considerations:

Consider T3 therapy
Assess and treat iron, selenium, iodine and zinc
