Clinical notes

INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR-1 (IGF-1)
Specimen Type: Serum
IGF-1 (Somatomedin C) 37 nmol/L (10-32)

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth
factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) measurements can be used to assess
growth hormone (GH) excess or deficiency. For all applications, IGF1
measurement has generally been shown to have superior diagnostic
accuracy. In particular, for the diagnosis and follow-up of acromegaly
and gigantism, IGFBP3 measurement adds little extra diagnostic
information.

Elevated IGF1 levels support the diagnosis of acromegaly or gigantism in
individuals with appropriate symptoms or signs. In successfully treated
patients, levels should be within the reference interval, ideally within
the lower third.
