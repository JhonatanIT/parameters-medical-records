REMARKS

1. HbA1c is used for monitoring diabetic control. It reflects the mean plasma glucose over three months

2. HbAic may be falsely low in diabetics with hemolytic disease. In these individuals a plasma fructosamine level may be used which evaluates diabetes over 15
days.

3. Inappropriately low HbA1c values may be reported due to hemolysis, recent blood transfusion, acute blood loss, hypertriglyceridemia, chronic liver disease.
Drugs like dapsone, ribavinn, antiretroviral drugs, trimethoprim, may also cause interference with estimation of HbA1c, causing falsely low values.

4. HbA1c may be increased in patients with polycythemia or post-splenectomy.

5. Inappropriately higher values of HbA1c may be caused due to iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, alcohol intake, uremia, hyperbilirubinemia and large doses
of aspirin. -

6. Trends in HbA1c are a better indicator of diabetic control than a solitary test. 7. Any sample with >15% HbA1c should be suspected of having a hemoglobin
vanant, especially in a non-diabetic patient. Similarly, below 4% should prompt additional studies to determine the possible presence of variant hemoglobin.

8. HbA 1c target in pregnancy is to attain level <6 % .

9. HbA‘1c target in paediatric age group is to attain level < 7.5 %.

Method : lon-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
